# Gapminder-Dataset-Analysis
This repository contains the files from a statistical analysis piece on the Gapminder Dataset.

The data is obtained from the R library "Gapminder" and contains information about the life expectancy, population and GDP per capita for countries from all continents, spanning the time period 1952-2007. The analysis aims to assess how the life expectancy for each continent changes over time and what effect population, GDP per capita and time may have had on the life expectancy. A subset of the data are considered, particularly the years 1952, 1982 and 2007 with various visualisations used to explore the data and spot any trends before a multiple linear regression model is fitted to the data.
To accompany the statistical analysis, a seperate file containing SQL queries that were used to build a Tableau visualisation dashboard is included with the dashboard available to view [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryan.jackson6102/viz/GapminderDatasetVisualisation/Dashboard1)
